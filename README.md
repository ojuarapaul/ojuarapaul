# About me...

Hi there! I live in Vancouver, Canada, and I'm on the road to becoming a Full Stack Web Developer.
As I have an Architecture background, people suggest me to go take the UI/UX or Web Design path, but I think I'm more into code.

Me in a few lines:

- I am @ojuarapaul. As of 2022, I am a Full Stack Web Dev student. Take a look at my online portfolio: https://ojuarapaul.github.io/myportfolio/index.html.
- I’m interested in all aspects of full stack development.
- I’m currently proficient in HTML | CSS | Javascript | Python | and studying Typescript | JSON | jQuery | APIs | Node | React | MongoDB | Web3 | DApps | Flask | Django. 
- This is not a list with some random languages, libraries and frameworks. For example, I do not mention PHP, Vue or Angular. or Java. Useful as they are, I certainly will learn them afterwards, if I need to, but that's my priority list for now.
- I’m looking to collaborate on any project if I can be a useful asset.
- How to reach me? Well, just email ojuarapaul@gmail.com. It won't take long for you to get my reply ;-).
